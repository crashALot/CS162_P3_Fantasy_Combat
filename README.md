# CS162_P3_Fantasy_Combat
In this program I design a fantasy combat game that uses multiple classes, implements characters using polymorphism, and implements a menu to allow the user to test the characters. The characters also have their own characteristics as well as special abilities. Each combat between 2 characters ends when one of the characters die. Harry Potter even makes an appearance!
